# THE PRACTICE EXPERIMENT
A simple and fastidiously commented entry-point into **Psychtoolbox** and how our **MATLAB** psychophysics experiments actually operate.

## You will need: 
1. **MATLAB**
  * Available for free as a Monash student: http://intranet.monash.edu.au/esolutions/software/catalogue/
2. **Psychtoolbox**
  * Available here: http://psychtoolbox.org/

## Description:
This _practice_ experiment is intended for those with a basic knowledge of **MATLAB** that hope to grasp the essentials of a running a simple perceptual experiment employing **Psychtoolbox**.

Clone the repository and have a play, if you make some cool updates to the task (perhaps some analysis scripts or extended, helpful comments) open a pull request and we might add it!

The critical m-file for running the experiment is in the `scripts` subfolder: [`practice_runExp.m`](./scripts/)
